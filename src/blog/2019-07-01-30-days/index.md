We are only 30 days away from the Linux Developer Conference Brazil -- [linuxdev-br](https://linuxdev-br.net/).
With a confirmed agenda of 20 distinct speakers, workshops and an audience
composed by developers, students, researchers, FOSS enthusiasts and companies
that works in the Open Source world, the conference follows firmly in its mission
of integrating the Brazilian Linux community and taking it to the international level.

This year, the linuxdev-br will happen jointly at the Radisson Paulista Hotel
and at the University of São Paulo, both in São Paulo - SP, between August 2nd
and 4th. Amongst the confirmed speakers, the conference brings internationally
acclaimed names such as Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, John “maddog” Hall, Hans
Verkuil, Valgrant Cascadian, Holger Levsen, Alexandre Oliva and many more.
Besides the talks, the event agenda also includes Oopen -Ssource development
related workshops, which will be hosted at the dependencies of the Instituto de
Matemática e Estatística in the University of São Paulo (IME-USP).

Besides the technical contents, the conference will also provide an open space
for the audience to interact during the coffee breaks. There will also be a main
happy hour event by the end of the Saturday schedule. The linuxdev-br is a
conference designed to promote the interaction of its participants irrespectively
to any skill level -- it is the right place for you to know people who will
contribute to the way you see and understand things in the Open Source community.
